# Quickstart

For quick access, download the packaged zip-file from releases. This file can be used as a base on, for example, Overleaf.

There are some different type of files that you may come across in each course note repository. For your convenience they and their contents are labeled as follows:

| Symbol | Meaning |
| :----: | ------- |
| ✅  | Complete course notes. Usually containing examples and structure similar to that of the lectures' |
| 📝 | Revision notes. Usually short summaries and examples for use before an exam |
| ⚠️ | Incomplete notes. May be lacking notes from lectures or be otherwise incomplete |
| 🏳️ | Language unknown or not of importance |
| 🇸🇪 | Written in Swedish |
| 🇬🇧 | Written in English |

# Purpose of the repository
<a name="purpose"></a>

Since we were unable to find a good base LaTeX template we decided to upload a template of our own. Feel free to use/modify it. It is a very barebones template that is supposed to act as a base to start on. 

# Contributing
<a name="contributing"></a>

Any help with the project is more than welcome. If you have a course, an assignment, a project or the like you would like to share, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request to get the process in motion.
